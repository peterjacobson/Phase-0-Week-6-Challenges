# Cipher Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops
- Break a large problem down into smaller steps
- Identify and rewrite repetitive code
- Refactor a method into a class structure

## Summary
The N.S.A. just broke Kim Jong Un's cipher that he's been using to give instructions to his military commanders! We wrote the following program to decipher the messages. As the N.S.A.'s best programmer on staff, your job is to refactor the code.

In this challenge, you'll work with a pair to refactor some existing code to make it more readable and follow Ruby best practices. Then you will compare your solution with the other solutions. This is a long method. Use your newly-developed skills with classes and driver test code to break this code into a class structure and call the methods within it.

## Release 0: Run the code
See what the expected output is.

## Release 1:  Read the code
Identify what each line of code is doing. It's located in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

Write comments next to or above each line with an explanation.
Really focus on breaking each step down. You want to understand every line (except for 68 and 69). You do not need to understand each part of these lines because they use regular expressions that look for one or more of any digit. We aren't asking you to learn regular expressions in Phase 0, so you don't need to refactor them.

## Release 2: Write Tests
Use [driver test code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md). What will always be the same using this cipher? What changes? Write driver test code based on what you discover.

## Release 3: [Refactor (by rewriting) the initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md)
  - Clean up the variable names.
  - The original code used a hard-coded hash to do the encryption. Can you create a simple algorithm instead? The original shift was by 4 characters. What would happen if it was changed to 10? Would your class be able to handle that change easily?

## Release 4: Push!
Push your solution to Github, then request feedback on Slack
