# The Bakery Challenge

## Learning Competencies
- Identify and explain what code is doing
- Identify and rewrite repetitive code
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods

## Summary
Your future career will require you to deal with a lot of "legacy code," i.e. code that works as intended, but is difficult to modify. Sometimes you will be given the option to start over or modify the original code. Other times you will be forced to work with legacy code due to time or budget constraints. In this challenge, you will need to refactor the existing code, while making it work the same way. The driver test code should still print "true" without being modified (apart from one test - figure out why!).

You'll be copying the code from the [bakery_challenge.rb](bakery_challenge.rb) file. When you finish, you'll post your solution to the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 0: Run the code
Whenever you get a set of code, you want to run it to make sure it works. Run the code in your terminal before making any changes.

## Release 1: Identify the purpose
Based on the test code at the bottom, what is the code doing (in general)? Identify the inputs and outputs. What do the tests output and why?

What does the value represent for each key in the hash? 

## Release 2: Read, Indent, and Comment
Read through the code, indenting as you go. After each block, write a comment to explain what the code is doing.

## Release 3: Refactor
When you get to code that is difficult to read, seems redundant, or badly executed, pause and refactor it. Make sure your changes don't break any of the tests! Refactor with future expandability in mind. You may decide to add some features later!

## Release 4: Reflect
When done, reflect on your learning.

## Release 5: Submit your challenge!
Push your solution to GitHub in the [my_solution.rb](my_solution.rb) file.

## Release 6: (Optional)
(In case you didn't get enough of the delicious horrible-code)

Expand the program for the customer based on their requests. Use the methodology you've been practicing. (Write [Driver Test Code](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/driver-code.md), [Pseudocode](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/pseudocode.md), [Write your initial solution](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/initial-solution.md), [Refactor](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/refactoring.md), [Reflect](https://github.com/dev-academy-phase0/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)).


Hi! I am a small bakery owner who has a Ruby program that calculates the
number of items I need to bake for a customer with a favorite food.
I love the program as it is, but I want to add a couple of features:

1. The owner wants to have options to include a mix of all items, rather than favorite foods.
2. The owner wants to add the following items to the menu: pudding (feeds two people), bundt cake (feeds 4 people), and mega-cupcakes (feeds 3 people).


*NOTE: Write your own tests based on your expansion. The original tests should still pass.*
